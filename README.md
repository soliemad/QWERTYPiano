# QWERTYPiano

[View demo here](https://yasssoliman.github.io/QWERTYPiano/Panio.html)

The goad of this project was to create a piano app that would be lightweight. It doesnt use any pre recorded piano sounds that require storage. Every keyboard note is calculated in javascript and played.

Added cool feature where an effect draws on the screen every key you press!
